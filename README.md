# Conducting_Security_Audit
As a part of Course 2 Play if Safe I want to conduct the Security Audit 
Botium Toys: Scope, goals, and risk assessment report 
Scope: In this section the scope is defined for Internal Security at Botium Toys. In this senario all the assests and procedures need to be examined.
Goals: In this section we need to asses and examine the existing control and complience for implimaentsion as a best practice.

Risk assessment

Risk description
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does
not have all of the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and
international regulations and standards.

Control best practices
The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify. Botium Toys will need to
dedicate resources to identify assets so they can appropriately manage them.
Additionally, they will need to classify existing assets and determine the impact of the
loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.

Risk score
On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of
controls and adherence to compliance best practices.

Additional comments
The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium, because the IT
department does not know which assets would be at risk. The risk to assets or fines
from governing bodies is high because Botium Toys does not have all of the necessary
controls in place and is not fully adhering to best practices related to compliance
regulations that keep critical data private/secure. Review the following bullet points for
specific details:
● Currently, all Botium Toys employees have access to internally stored data and
may be able to access cardholder data and customers’ PII/SPII.
● Encryption is not currently used to ensure confidentiality of customers’ credit
card information that is accepted, processed, transmitted, and stored locally in
the company’s internal database.
● Access controls pertaining to least privilege and separation of duties have not
been implemented.
● The IT department has ensured availability and integrated controls to ensure
data integrity.
